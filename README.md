1.	State Space in Sudoku:

The state space in Sudoku represents all possible configurations of the Sudoku board.
Each state corresponds to a unique arrangement of numbers on the board, where empty cells are represented by the value 0.

2.	Initial State:

The initial state is the starting configuration of the Sudoku puzzle, given in the form of a 9x9 grid with some initial values and empty cells.

3.	Actions:

In the context of the Sudoku solver, the actions are the decisions made by the algorithm to place numbers in empty cells.
o	The solver iteratively tries different numbers (1 to 9) in empty cells until a solution is found.

4.	Transition Model:
o	The transition model describes how the state evolves as the algorithm makes decisions. In this case, the transition occurs when the algorithm places a number in an empty cell.

5.	Goal State:

o	The goal state is reached when the Sudoku puzzle is solved. In the solved state, each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.

6.	Search Algorithm:

The code uses a recursive backtracking search algorithm to explore the state space systematically.
The algorithm tries different numbers in empty cells, backtracks when it encounters a contradiction, and continues until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

7.	Backtracking:

The backtracking mechanism allows the algorithm to undo decisions that lead to an invalid state and explore alternative paths in the state space.

8.	Completing the State Space:

The algorithm traverses the state space by recursively exploring different possibilities until a solution is found or all options are exhausted.

In summary, the Sudoku solver navigates through the state space of possible Sudoku board configurations, employing backtracking to explore different paths until a valid solution is discovered. The state space concept is fundamental in understanding how the algorithm systematically explores and searches for a solution in the space of all possible Sudoku configurations.
